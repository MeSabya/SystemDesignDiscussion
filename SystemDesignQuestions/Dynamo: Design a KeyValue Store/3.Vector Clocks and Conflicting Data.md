# Vector Clocks and Conflicting Data

## What problem Vector Clocks Solves?
When we have a single machine, a timeline of events is relatively easy to create, even if we have multiple processes (threads) creating events. This is due to all the events, across processes, sharing the same Physical Clock. When each one of those events logs the time in which it executed, we can guarantee when constructing a timeline that all events will be placed in the correct order with respect to each other. This is due to the same Physical Clock being used for all timestamps, providing a single global view of time

However, when we move to a distributed system we cannot rely on this property anymore.
Let’s take our previous example to prove this. If we have events leading up to an INSERT now happening across multiple machines, each with their own local clock, and we use timestamps to place events in chronological order, we now have to guarantee that every machines clock has the exact same time. This is known as having a Global Clock, and is not easily achieved in a distributed system [Figure 3].

## Technical details behind Vector Clocks

With this approach, each process keeps a vector (a list of integers) with an integer for each local clock of every process within the system. If there are N processes, there will be a vector of N size maintained by each process. Given a process (Pi) with a vector (v), Vector Clocks implement the Logical Clock rules as follows:

**Rule 1**: 
before executing an event (excluding the event of receiving a message) process Pi increments the value v[i] within its local vector by 1. This is the element in the vector that refers to Processor(i)’s local clock.
local_vector[i] = local_vector[i] + 1

**Rule 2**: 
when receiving a message (the message must include the senders vector) loop through each element in the vector sent and compare it to the local vector, updating the local vector to be the maximum of each element. Then increment your local clock within the vector by 1 [Figure 5].

### Disadvantages:
Vector Clocks provide a causally consistent ordering of events, however this does come at a price. You can see that we need to send the entire Vector to each process for every message sent, in order to keep the vector clocks in sync. When there are a large number of processes this technique can become extremely expensive, as the vector sent is extremely large.
