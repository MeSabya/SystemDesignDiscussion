# High-level Design

Our proposed system should do the following:

- Provide suggestions based on the search history of the user.
- Store all the new and trending queries in the database to include them in the list of suggestions.

When a user starts typing a query, every typed character hits one of the application servers. Let’s assume that we have a suggestions service that obtains the top ten suggestions from the cache, Redis, and returns them as a response to the client. In addition to this, suppose we have another service known as an assembler. An assembler collects the user searches, applies some analytics to rank the searches, and stores them in a NoSQL database that’s distributed across several nodes.

The web servers encapsulate the internal system architecture and provide other services, such as authentication, monitoring, request shaping, management, and more.

## API design
Since the system provides suggestions to the user and adds trending queries to the databases, we need the following APIs.

### getSuggestions(prefix)
This API call retrieves suggestions from the servers. This call is made via the suggestion service and returns the response to the client.
prefix : This refers to whatever the user has typed in the search bar.

### Add trending queries to the database
addToDatabase(query)
This API call adds a trending query to the database via an assembler if the query has already been searched and has crossed a certain threshold.
