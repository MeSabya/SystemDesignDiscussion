## Queueing
A distributed queue is a major building block used by a scheduler. The simplest scheduling approach is to push the task into the queue on a first-come, first-served basis. If there are 10,000 nodes (resources) in a cluster (cloud), the task scheduler quickly extracts tasks from the queue and schedules them on the nodes. But, if all the resources are currently busy, then tasks will need to wait in the queue, and small tasks might need to wait longer.

This scheduling mechanism can affect the reliability of the system, availability of the system, and priority of tasks. There could be cases where we want urgent execution of a task—for example, a task that notifies a user that their account was accessed from an unrecognized device. So, we can’t rely only on the first-come, first-serve to schedule tasks. Instead, we categorize the tasks and set appropriate priorities. We have the following three categories for our tasks:

- Tasks that can’t be delayed.
- Tasks that can be delayed.
- Tasks that need to be executed periodically (for example, every 5 minutes, or every hour, or every day).

## Execution cap
Some tasks take very long to execute and occupy the resource blocking other tasks. 
The execution cap is an important parameter to consider while scheduling tasks.
If we completely allocate a resource to a single task and wait for that task’s completion, some tasks might not halt because of a bug in the task script that doesn’t let it finish its execution. We let the clients set the execution cap for their tasks. After that specified time, we should stop task execution, release the resource, and allocate it to the next task in the queue. If the task execution stops due to the execution cap limit, our system notifies the respective clients of these instances. The client needs to do appropriate remedial actions for such cases.

If clients don’t set the execution cap, the scheduler uses its default upper bound on the maximum allowed time to kill the tasks.

## Prioritization
There are tasks that need urgent execution. For example, in a social application like Facebook, the users can mark themselves safe during an emergency situation, such as an earthquake. The tasks that carry out this activity should be executed in a timely manner, otherwise this feature would be useless to Facebook users. Sending an email notification to the customers that their account was debited a certain amount of money is another example of tasks that require urgent execution.

To prioritize the tasks, the task scheduler maintains a delay tolerance parameter for each task and executes the task close to its delay tolerance. Delay tolerance is the maximum amount of time a task execution could be delayed.

## Task idempotency
If the task executes successfully, but for some reason the machine fails to send an acknowledgement, the scheduler will schedule the task again. The task is executed again, and we end up with the wrong result, which means the task was non-idempotent.

# Non-functional requirements fulfilled by our task scheduler system

## Availability
The first component in our design was a rate limiter that is appropriately replicated and ensures availability. Task submission is done by several nodes. If a node that submits a task fails, the other nodes take its place. The queue in which we push the task is also distributed in nature, ensuring availability. We always have resources available because we continuously monitor if we need to add or remove resources. Each component in the design is distributed and makes the overall system available.

## Durability
We store the tasks in a persistent distributed database and push the tasks into the queue near their execution time. Once a task is submitted, it is in the database until its execution.

## Scalability
Our task scheduler provides scalability because the task submitter is distributed in our design. We can add more nodes to the cluster to submit an increasing number of tasks. The tasks are then saved into a distributed relational database, which is also scalable. The tasks from RDB are then pushed to a distributed queue, which can scale with an increasing number of tasks. We can add more queues for different types of tasks. We can also add more resources depending on the resource-to-demand ratio.

## Fault tolerance
A task is not removed from the queue the first time it is sent for execution. If the execution fails, we retry for the maximum number of allowed attempts. If the task contains an infinite loop, we kill the task after some specified time and notify the user.

## Bounded waiting time
We don’t let the users wait for an infinite time. We have a limit on the maximum waiting time. If the limit is reached and we are unable to schedule the task for some reason, we notify the users and ask them to try again.
