# High-level Design of a Distributed Cache

### Requirements
Let us start by understanding the requirements of our solution.

#### Functional
The following are the functional requirements:

- Insert data: The user of a distributed cache system must be able to insert an entry to the cache.
- Retrieve data: The user should be able to retrieve data corresponding to a specific key.

#### Non-functional requirements
Weâ€™ll consider the following non-functional requirements:

**High performance**: The primary reason for the cache is to enable fast retrieval of data. Therefore, both the insert and retrieve operations must be fast.

**Scalability**: The cache system should scale horizontally with no bottlenecks on an increasing number of requests.

**High availability**: The unavailability of the cache will put an extra burden on the database servers, which can also go down at peak load intervals. We also require our system to survive occasional failures of components and network, as well as power outages.

**Consistency**: Data stored on the cache servers should be consistent. For example, different cache clients retrieving the same data from different cache servers (primary or secondary) should be up to date.

**Affordability**: Ideally, the caching system should be designed from commodity hardware instead of an expensive supporting component within the design of a system.

### API design
The API design for this problem is sufficiently easy since there are only two basic operations.

#### Insertion
The API call to perform insertion should look like this:

insert(key, value)

#### Retrieval
The API call to retrieve data from the cache should look like this:

retrieve(key)
