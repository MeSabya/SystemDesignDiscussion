# What if a Kafka node/broker fails and all the partitions tied to that node become unavailable?
To overcome this scenario, Kafka uses replication. A duplicate of each partition is maintained in all the nodes. At all times, one broker ‘owns’ a partition and is the node through which applications write/read from the partition. This is called a partition leader. It replicates the data it receives to other brokers, called followers. They store the data as well and are ready to be elected as the leader in case the leader node dies.

At any point of time, all the replicas will be identical to the leader (original) partition. This is called In-Sync Replication. For a producer/consumer to write/read from a partition, they need to know its leader so, this information needs to be available from somewhere. Kafka stores such metadata in Zookeeper.
