## API design

### Search
We need to implement the search function. The API call for searching based on categories like “cafes” will be:

search(category, user_location, radius)

### Add a place
The API call for adding a place is below:

add_place(name_of_place, description_of_place, category, latitude, longitude, photo}

### Add a review
The API call for adding a place is below:

add_review(place_ID, user_ID, review_description, rating)
