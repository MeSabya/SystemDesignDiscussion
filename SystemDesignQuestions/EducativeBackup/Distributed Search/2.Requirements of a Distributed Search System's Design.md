# Requirements of a Distributed Search System's Design

## Functional requirements#
The following is a functional requirement of a distributed search system:

**Search**: 
Users should get relevant content based on their search queries.

## Non-functional requirements#
Here are the non-functional requirements of a distributed search system:

Availability: The system should be highly available to the users.
Scalability: The system should have the ability to scale with the increasing amount of data. In other words, it should be able to index a large amount of data.
Fast search on big data: The user should get the results quickly, no matter how much content they are searching.
Reduced cost: The overall cost of building a search system should be less.

## Resource estimation#
Let’s estimate the total number of servers, storage, and bandwidth that is required by the distributed search system. We’ll calculate these numbers using an example of a YouTube search.

Number of servers estimation#
To estimate the number of servers, we need to know how many daily active users per day are using the search feature on YouTube and how many requests per second our single server can handle. We assume the following numbers:

The number of daily active users who use the search feature is three million.
The number of requests a single server can handle is 1,000.
The number of servers required is calculated using this formula:

If three million users are searching concurrently, three million search requests are being generated at one time. A single server handles 1,000 requests at a time. Dividing three million by 1,000 gives us 3,000 servers.

## Storage estimation#
Each video’s metadata is stored in a separate JSON document. Each document is uniquely identified by the video ID. This metadata contains the title of the video, its description, the channel name, and a transcript. We assume the following numbers for estimating the storage required to index one video:

The size of a single JSON document is 200 KB.
The number of unique terms or keys extracted from a single JSON document is 1,000.
The amount of storage space required to add one term into the index table is 100 Bytes.
The following formula is used to compute the storage required to index one video:

In the table above, we calculate the storage required to index one video. We have already seen that the total storage required per video is 300 KB. Assuming that, on average, the number of videos uploaded per day on YouTube is 6,000, let’s calculate the total storage required to index the videos uploaded per day. The following formula is used to compute the storage required to index the videos uploaded to YouTube in one day:

The total storage required to index 6,000 videos uploaded per day on YouTube is 1.8 GB. This storage requirement is just an estimation for YouTube. The storage need will increase if we provide a distributed search system as a service to multiple tenants.
