## Why do we need a search system?#

Nowadays, we see a search bar on almost every website. We use that search bar to pick out relevant content from the enormous amount of content available on that website. A search bar enables us to quickly find what we’re looking for. For example, there are plenty of courses present on the Educative website. If we didn’t have a search feature, users would have to scroll through many pages and read the name of each course to find the one they’re looking for.

Let’s take another example. There are billions of videos uploaded and stored on YouTube. Imagine if YouTube didn’t provide us with a search bar. How would we find a specific video among the millions of videos that have been posted on YouTube over the years? It would take months to navigate through all of those videos and find the one we need. Users find it challenging to find what they’re looking for simply by scrolling around.

Search engines are an even bigger example. We have billions of websites on the Internet. Each website has many web pages and there is plenty of content on each of these web pages. With so much content, the Internet would practically be useless without search engines, and users would end up lost in a sea of irrelevant data. Search engines are, essentially, filters for the massive amount of data available. They let users quickly obtain information that is of true interest without having to sift through too many unnecessary web pages.

Behind every search bar, there is a search system.

## What is a search system?#
A search system is a system that takes some text input, a search query, from the user and returns the relevant content in a few seconds or less. There are three main components of a search system, namely:

A crawler, which fetches content and creates documents.
An indexer, which builds a searchable index.
A searcher, which responds to search queries by running the search query on the index created by the indexer.
