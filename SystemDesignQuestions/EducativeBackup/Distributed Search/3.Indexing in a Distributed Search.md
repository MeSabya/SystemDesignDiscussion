# Indexing in a Distributed Search

## Indexing#
Indexing is the organization and manipulation of data that’s done to facilitate fast and accurate information retrieval.

### Build a searchable index#
The simplest way to build a searchable index is to assign a unique ID to each document and store it in a database table, as shown in the following table. The first column in the table is the ID of the text and the second column contains the text from each document.

The response time to a search query depends on a few factors:

The data organization strategy in the database.
The size of the data.
The processing speed and the RAM of the machine that’s used to build the index and process the search query.
Running search queries on billions of documents that are document-level indexed will be a slowprocess, which may take many minutes, or even hours. Let’s look at another data organization and processing technique that helps reduce the search time.
