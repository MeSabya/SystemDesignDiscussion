## Memcached versus Redis#

Even though Memcached and Redis both belong to the NoSQL family, there are subtle aspects that set them apart:

Simplicity: Memcached is simple, but it leaves most of the effort for managing clusters left to the developers of the cluster. This, however, means finer control using Memcached. Redis, on the other hand, automates most of the scalability and data division tasks.

Persistence: Redis provides persistence by properties like append only file (AOF) and Redis database (RDB) snapshot. There’s no persistence support in Memcached. But this limitation can be catered to by using third-party tools.

Data types: Memcached stores objects, whereas Redis supports strings, sorted sets, hash maps, bitmaps, and hyper logs. However, the maximum key or value size is configurable.

Memory usage: Both tools allow us to set a maximum memory size for caching. Memcached uses the slab allocation method for reducing fragmentation. However, when we update the existing entries’ size or store many small objects, there may be a wastage of memory. Nonetheless, there are configuration workarounds to resolve such issues.

Multithreading: Redis runs as a single process using one core, whereas Memcached can efficiently use multicore systems with multithreading technology. We could argue that Redis was designed to be a single-threaded process that reduces the complexity of multithreaded systems. Nonetheless, multiple Redis processes can be executed for concurrency. At the same time, Redis has improved over the years by tweaking its performance. Therefore, Redis can store small data items efficiently. Memcached can be the right choice for file sizes above 100 K.

Replication: As stated before, Redis automates the replication process via few commands, whereas replication in Memcached is again subject to the usage of third-party tools. Architecturally, Memcached can scale well horizontally due to its simplicity. Redis provides scalability through clustering that’s considerably complex.

The table below summarizes some of the main differences and common features between Memcached and Redis:

To summarize, Memcached is preferred for smaller, simpler read-heavy systems, whereas Redis is useful for systems that are complex and are both read- and write-heavy.

## Based on the implementation details, which of the two frameworks (Memcached or Redis) has a striking similarity with the distributed cache that we designed in the previous lesson?

The answer is Memcached. The reasons are as follows:

Client software chooses which cache server to use with a hashing algorithm.
Server software stores the values against each key using an internal hash table.
Least recently used (LRU) is used as the eviction policy.
There’s no communication between different cache servers.

## Question 2
Why do third-party tools exist for persisting Memcached data?

It’s because a lot of data is read and written to cache servers, and they may occasionally crash for whatever reason. After restarting, building a cache from scratch can take up to hours in specific scenarios, and that ultimately reduces system performance. Therefore, cache data may be persisted to disk to be loaded on a restart.

## Question 3
What is the advantage of storing different data structures as compared to strings only?


The main advantage is that Redis can modify data in place without wasting network bandwidth by downloading and uploading. It saves network bandwidth, but it also saves time and effort by avoiding the serialization and deserialization of data.
