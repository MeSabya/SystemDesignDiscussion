# System Design Basics: Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy

üëâProxy (also known as forward proxy) is a server that makes ‚Äúrequests‚Äù on behalf of a client, thus anonymizing the client from the server. With a proxy server, the server doesn‚Äôt know the client.

üëâHowever, a reverse proxy acts on behalf of the server, it appears to clients to be an ordinary server. Reverse proxies forward request to one or more ordinary servers that handle the request. The response from the reverse proxy server is returned as if it came directly from the original server, leaving the client with no knowledge of the original server.

### Advantages of Proxy server

*Proxy server hides the identity of client from the server by sending requests on behalf of it.*

#### Caching
Whenever a proxy is introduced it brings the benefits of caching with it. 
The proxy server can cache any data which is not expected to change. 
Now when another client sends a request for the same content, the proxy server can send back the cached response instead of contacting the server again. 
Caching has advantages of **low latency, reduced network traffic, and higher network bandwidth.**

#### Anonymity
The final destination which is the YouTube server in this case will not know about the client from which the request originated.

#### Traffic control
Proxy servers can help in controlling traffic as all the traffic goes through them, they can block certain content which might not be appropriate for certain reasons. For example, proxy servers in an organization can protect its employees‚Äô machines from certain malicious sites.

#### Logging
As all the traffic goes through a proxy, it has visibility through logs.

### Advantages of Reverse Proxy

*In the reverse proxy paradigm, as shown above, the reverse proxy server hides the final server that served the request from the client.*

#### Caching

Same as above.

#### Anonymity
Anonymity protects the destination servers from potential attacks like DDoS attacks.

#### Load balancing:
One of the greatest benefits of a reverse proxy is load balancing among the servers. The reverse proxy can use any load balancing algorithm like round-robin, resource-based, etc. Load balancing can help evenly distribute traffic among servers leading to reliability and availability.

#### Router/Ingress:
The reverse proxy can act as an ingress or a router in Kubernetes or micro-services architecture.

#### Increased security
Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client

#### Increased scalability and flexibility 
Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration

#### SSL termination 
Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations
Removes the need to install X.509 certificates on each server

#### Compression - 
Compress server responses

#### Static content 
Serve static content directly
HTML/CSS/JS
Photos
Videos
Etc

## Load balancer vs reverse proxy
- Deploying a load balancer is useful when you have multiple servers. Often, load balancers route traffic to a set of servers serving the same function.
- Reverse proxies can be useful even with just one web server or application server, opening up the benefits described in the previous section.
  Solutions such as NGINX and HAProxy can support both layer 7 reverse proxying and load balancing.

## Disadvantage(s): reverse proxy
- Introducing a reverse proxy results in increased complexity.
- A single reverse proxy is a single point of failure, configuring multiple reverse proxies (ie a failover) further increases complexity.
