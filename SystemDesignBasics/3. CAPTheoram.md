# What is cap theorem?
👉 *The CAP theorem states that a distributed database system can only guarantee two out of these three characteristics: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.*

**To prove** ☝️:


For example, suppose we have a very simple distributed system with only two server S1 and S2 and assume our distributed system is Consistent, Available and Partition tolerant all at the same time.

Suppose there is network failure, since our system is partition tolerant it suppose to work. During the network failure client sends a write request to server S1. S1 will receive the request and process it.
Our system is consistent, so S1 must update the value in S2 before confirming to the client but S1 cannot update S2 because there is a network failure. In this case, the request to S1 will timeout which means our system is not available.
If our system Available, S1 will respond to the client without waiting for an update in S2. If any client makes a read request to S2 for the same information it will receive older value not the result of recent write. This means our system cannot be consistent when it is available.
This proves CAP theorem.

## Consistency:
A system is said to be consistent if all nodes see the same data at the same time. If we perform a read operation on a consistent system, it should return the value of the most recent write operation. This means that, the read should cause all nodes to return the same data, i.e., the value of the most recent write. It is a system’s ability to maintain ACID properties of transactions.

👉 Example →From a practical point of view, a consistency model answers to questions like: If Client 1 adds an object to a distributed data store at 1:00 pm and Client 2 tries to read the same object at 1:01 pm, will Client 2 be able to get the new object? Or will it get a 404 because the resource was not found?
The answer is that…it depends. There are many factors to consider to answer such a question. One of them is the consistency model adopted by the distributed data store.
Examples of consisteny models are:

### Eventual Consistency
Eventual consistency is a theoretical guarantee that, provided no new updates to an entity are made, all reads of the entity will eventually return the last updated value. The Internet Domain Name System (DNS) is a well-known example of a system with an eventual consistency model. DNS servers do not necessarily reflect the latest values but, rather, the values are cached and replicated across many directories over the Internet. It takes a certain amount of time to replicate modified values to all DNS clients and servers.

### Strong Consistency
In contrast, traditional relational databases have been designed based on the concept of strong consistency, also called immediate consistency. This means that data viewed immediately after an update will be consistent for all observers of the entity.

>To have strong consistency, developers must compromise on the scalability and performance of their application. Simply put, data has to be locked during the period of update or replication process to ensure that no other processes are updating the same data.

👉 *To generalize the examples just given, use cases with very large numbers of entities often suggest that eventual consistency is the best model. If there are a very large number of results in a query, then the user experience may not be affected by the inclusion or exclusion of specific entities. On the other hand, use cases with a small number of entities and a narrow context suggest that strong consistency is required*

### Availability
Availability in a distributed system ensures that the system remains operational 100% of the time. Every request gets a (non-error) response regardless of the individual state of a node.

### Partition tolerance 
System does not fail, even if the network between nodes break. Nodes might not be able to communicate or delays between nodes shouldn’t affect the system.

***CP database***: A CP database delivers consistency and partition tolerance at the expense of availability. When a partition occurs between any two nodes, the system has to shut down the non-consistent node until the partition is resolved. The system will return an error or time-out and making it unavailable.

***AP database***: An AP database delivers availability and partition tolerance at the expense of consistency. When a partition occurs, all nodes remain available but those at the wrong end of a partition might return an older version of data than others.

***CA database***: This is not possible in any distributed architecture. It can be found only in some non-scalable monolithic architecture.
