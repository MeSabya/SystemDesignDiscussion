## You should memorize the following numbers as it will help you come up with estimates quickly:

10⁶ Bytes = 1 Million Bytes = 1 MB

10⁹ Bytes = 1 Billion Bytes = 1 GB

10¹² Bytes = 1 Trillion Bytes = 1 TB

2³² = 4 Billion

Time taken to read 1 MB serially from memory = 0.25 ms

Time taken to read 1 MB serially from SSD = 1 ms

Time taken to read 1 MB serially from disk = 20 ms

Disk seek = 10 ms

Same data centre roundtrip = 0.5 ms

Inter-datacenter roundtrip = 150 ms

Seconds in a day = 86,400 = 10⁵ (approximated to 100,000)

2³² Bytes = 4 Billion Bytes = 4 GB

Twitter generates 500 M tweets a day with 200 M daily active user (DAU) & 300 M monthly active users (MAU)

Stack overflow has 5 M DAU

Wikipedia has ~ 6M articles

The average size of an image is 3 MB
