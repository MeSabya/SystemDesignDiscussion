# Consistency Guarantees in Distributed Systems Explained Simply

*consistency models are trade-offs between concurrency of operations vs ordering of operations or in other words, between performance and correctness of the operations.*

## Consistency in Database Systems: 
Database consistency ensures the data base entities are in healthy state i.e; they follow all the application integrity constraints. Ex: any operation must make sure maximum data type length, unique key, primary key, foreign key constraints etc are absolutely maintained. It does not care about the operation operating on the given data, rather the relevance of the outcome of the operation is more important.

## Consistency in Distributed Systems:
Consistency in distributed systems means every node / replica has the same view of data at a given point in time irrespective of whichever client has updated the data. When you make a request to any node, you receive the exact same response (even if itâ€™s an error) so that from the outside, it looks like there is a single node performing all the operations.

## The Challenge with consistency in Distributed Systems

For serving massive online traffic in the modern internet, itâ€™s very common to have an infrastructure set up with multiple replicas (or partitions). Whether itâ€™s your Facebook activity, GMail data or Amazonâ€™s order history â€” everything is replicated across datacenters, availability zones and possibly across countries to ensure data is not lost and the systems are always highly available in case one of the replica crashes. This poses a challenge â€” how to have consistent data across replicas? Without consistency, a mail that you have sent recently through GMail might disappear, an item deleted from Amazon cart might reappear. Or even worse, a financial transaction might be lost causing thousands of $$$ loss. While losing cart items is okay at times but losing $$$ is a big NO NO!

**Broadly, there are two kinds of consistency: Weak Consistency and Strong Consistency.**

## Defining Weak Consistency

### Eventual Consistency

In a distributed system, replicas eventually converge to the same state. Given no write operation is in progress for a given data item, eventual consistency guarantees that all replicas start serving Read requests with the last updated value.

ðŸ‘‰ There is absolutely no ordering guarantee on Reads and Writes. Arbitrary order applicable.

ðŸ‘‰ Any unit of execution which writes some value to an object, upon reading the same object back from another replica, the update could be invisible.

ðŸ‘‰ Reading the same data from different nodes simultaneously may return stale data.

**Real Life Examples:**

- The best and well known example is Internet Domain Name System (DNS) that successfully caters to billions of requests daily. DNS is a hierarchical, highly available system and it takes some time to propagate the update for a given entry across DNS servers and clients.
- Review or ratings of products in Amazon.
- Count of likes in Facebook.
- Views on YouTube videos.
- Stream of comments on Facebook live videos.
- Ticket price shown on the front page in an airline website.
- Fetching how many Facebook friends / WhatsApp contacts are online.

### Consistent Prefix Read
Consistent Prefix Read guarantees no replica reads data out of order even though the data read is stale at a given point in time. If a data x has gone through 3 versions say A, B, and C respectively with C being the most updated version, every replica receives these updates in the same order. 

ðŸ‘‰ Dirty Read / Stale Read is possible.

ðŸ‘‰ Global ordering guarantee applies for a given piece of data across replicas. Hence any unit of execution reads the operations in the same order.

ðŸ‘‰ No bound on staleness. A replica can replicate the latest version of a data in 2 ms whereas another can do in 100 ms or 200 ms or any arbitrary time. This makes Consistent Prefix Read a weaker consistency guarantee.

**Real Life Examples:**

- Sports apps which track score of soccer, cricket etc.
- Social media timelines (sorted by recency).

### Session Guarantees

**Session:** Itâ€™s an abstract concept to correlate multiple Read and Write operations together as a group.

**Example:**
when you login to Amazon for shopping, a session is created internally which keeps track of your activities and browsing history, cart updates for that session. Sessions can be identified with a unique id called session id. The life time of a session could be few seconds to days or more depending on the business use case. 

***Letâ€™s look at four important session guarantees below:***

#### Read-Your-Own-Write (RYOW) / Read-My-Write
Consider the following example:

ðŸ‘‰ This is a clear violation of RYOW consistency since there is only a single unit of execution performing the Write and Read operations yet itâ€™s unable to see its own update.

**Real Life Example**

If you delete a mail from Gmail and you get the confirmation, upon refreshing the page, you should not see the mail again in RYOW consistency.

#### Monotonic Read

Here,

- Initially all the replicas contain the same x = 5.
- At time t1, the client P writes x = 12 and letâ€™s assume itâ€™s immediately replicated to R1.
- As time t2 > t1, P makes a Read request for x to R1 and as R1 is already aware of the update, it returns the latest value 12 to P. This is Monotonic Read since from time t1, R1 always returns either 12 or any later value.
- At time t3 > t2 > t1, replica R3 is still unaware of the update due to replication lag, hence it still holds the older value x = 5. When the same process P requests R3 for the latest x, it returns 5 which confuses P since P has already seen the latest x = 12 in the earlier call. This Read is non-monotonic read.

#### Write Follows Read (WFR)

#### Monotonic write:

ðŸ‘‰ If a Write W1 happens before another Write W2 in a session, still the unit of execution is unable to see W1 while executing W2, the session is said to be out of order.

ðŸ‘‰ While an unit of execution is under MW guarantee within a session, other units of execution might not see the same updates on the same object at that point in time. MW does not give any guarantee on propagation time.

#### Session Consistency Real Life Examples:
- Shopping cart. If you add some item to cart in amazon.in, those items wonâ€™t be visible in amazon.co.uk as thatâ€™s another session.
- Updating profile picture on social media like Facebook, Twitter. You can see your own updates but there is no guarantee others see it during initial few seconds at least.
