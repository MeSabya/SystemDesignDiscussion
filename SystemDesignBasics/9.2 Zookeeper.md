# Zookeeper Overview

## What is Apache Zookeeper (ZK)? 

It is a library that enables coordination in distributed systems. Below are some of the distributed systems coordination problems that zookeeper solves:

- **Configuration management** — Managing application configuration that can be shared across servers in a cluster. The idea is to maintain any configuration in a centralized place so that all servers will see any change in configuration files/data.
- **Leader election** — Electing a leader in a multi-node cluster. You might need a leader to maintain a single point for an update request or distributing tasks from leader to worker nodes.
- **Locks in distributed systems** — distributed locks enables different systems to operate on a shared resource in a mutually exclusive way. Think of an example where you want to write to a shared file or any shared data. Before updating the shared resource, each server will acquire a lock and release it after the update.
- **Manage cluster membership** — Maintain and detect if any server leaves or joins a cluster and store other complex information of a cluster.

Zookeeper solves these problems using its magical tree structure file system called znodes, somewhat similar to the Unix file system. These znodes are analogous to folders and files in a Unix file system with some additional magical abilities :) Zookeeper provides primitive operations to manipulate these znodes, through which we will solve our distributed system problems.
