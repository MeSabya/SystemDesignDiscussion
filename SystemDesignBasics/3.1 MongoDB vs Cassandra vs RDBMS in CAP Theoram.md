# MongoDB vs Cassandra vs RDBMS, where do they stand in the CAP theorem?

## RDBMS(MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, etc)

- It‚Äôs no brainer that all RDBMS are Consistent as all reads and writes go to a single node/server.
- üëâ **How about availability? You might say, it is one single server and hence a single point of failure. So, how it‚Äôs categorized under Availability?**
As I said earlier CAP-Availability is not the same as day to day availability/downtime we talk about. In a single node system, there will not be any network partition hence if the node is up, it will always return success for any read/write operation and hence available.

***What happens when you replicate these Relational Databases?***

We can make such systems using any cluster manager systems like Zookeeper or etcd.
So does this mean these replicated relational databases are Available?
Not entirely, let‚Äôs see how.
If a leader disconnects from the cluster, it takes a few seconds to elect a new leader. So, definitely not an available system.
A client can always disconnect from the leader due to network partition even if both client and leader node is running fine. Hence making it unavailable.

#### What about consistency when data is replicated?

If the data is read and written from only master/primary node it's always Consistent.
If the read requests are sent to any of the secondary, we will lose consistency and might serve inconsistent data in case of network partition or say master takes time to replicate data.

**Most Important Point**
üëâ If RDBMS server is replicated, it's consistent ‚Äî only if reads and writes are performed only through the leader or master node.

*We generally categorize RDBMS in CA. Because Relational databases are a single node system and hence we do not need to worry about partition tolerance and hence if RDBMS server is up and running, it will always respond success for any read/write operation.*

## MongoDB (HBase, Redis)

- MongoDB is a single leader based system that can have multiple replicas. These replicas update themselves asynchronously from Leader‚Äôs OpLog.
- Each node maintains the heartbeat of every other node to keep track if other replicas or leader is alive or dead.
- If the leader/primary node goes down, replicas can identify and elect a new leader based on priority, if they can form the majority

### Consistency and Availability in MongoDB

##### Scenario 1: Default Behavior ‚Äî Both read and write from primary/leader
**By default, Mongo DB Client(MongoDB driver), sends all read/write requests to the leader/primary node.**

Again this default behavior allows Mongo DB to be a consistent system but not available due to the below reasons:
If a leader disconnects from the cluster, it takes a few seconds to elect a new leader. So, making it unavailable for writes and reads.
A client can always disconnect from the leader due to network partition even if both client and leader node is running fine. Hence making it unavailable.

üëâ So, if we use MongoDB client with its default behavior, MongoDB behaves as a Consistent system and not Available.

##### Scenario 2: Enable read from secondary
As we have seen in the previous scenario when a new leader is getting elected or if the client disconnects from the leader. Our system is not available for both read and write.


###### How do we change that and make the system available for reads?

*We could simply configure read-preference mode in MongoDB client to read from any secondary nodes.
But, by doing so we are breaking consistency. Now, a write to primary/leader can be successful but, secondary‚Äôs might not have updated the latest data from primary due to any reason.
So, with this setup, you get high availability for reads but lose consistency and inturn you get eventual consistency.*

**How can we solve the above problem in MongoDB and make the system ‚Äúhighly consistent‚Äù even when reads are going to multiple secondary nodes?**

MongoDB solves this by using ‚Äúwrite concerns‚Äù.
While writing data to MongoDB you could pass a write option. Mentioning the number of nodes the data should be written to make a write successful or you can pass ‚Äúmajority‚Äù, which indicates write would be successful if primary got acknowledgment from the majority of nodes.
This way you can even have the same data in all nodes if you write to all nodes.

In Summary, MongoDB can always be Consistent based on how you configure your client and the way you write data(using write options) and can be always available for reads but you can never make write always available, there will always be downtime when:
a) the new leader is getting elected
b) the client driver disconnects from the leader

## Cassandra (CouchDB, DynamoDB, Riak)-AP System 
In Cassandra, any coordinator nodes can accept read or write requests and forwards requests to respective replicas based on the partition key. Hence even if a replica/node goes down, others can serve the read/write requests. So, is it safe to say Cassandra is always available?
Hmmm not entirely, we will find out soon why.
In Cassandra, we can define the replication factor. If set to 3, Cassandra will replicate data to three nodes.

**Scenario 1: Default case ‚Äî No Consistency level defined**
In this case, when a write is sent to any node, the node returns success once the data is written to that node.
The other two replica nodes(if the replication factor is set to 3) will eventually get the data and hence sometimes Cassandra DB is called as it eventually consistent DB.
If for some reason the third replica didn‚Äôt get the updated copy of the data, it could be due to latency or network partition, or you just lost the packet.
Then, If you happen to read data from the node which is not updated yet, you will get inconsistent data.
Hence in its default settings, Cassandra is categorized as AP(Available and Partition Tolerant)

**Scenario 2: Read/Write request with Consistency levels**

In Cassandra, we can define the read/write consistency level in the Cassandra client while creating the Cassandra Session.

How Does Consistency level impacts write?

It ensures a write is successful only if it has written to the number of nodes given in the Consistency Level. These values can be ANY or ONE or QUORUM or ALL or a Number.

How Does the Consistency level impact read?
If the consistency level is THREE, Cassandra will read from the three replicas and return the latest data among the 3 nodes and update the other outdated replicas too.
So, Just by setting consistency level to QUORUM(majority) consistency. As these consistency level settings are applied to both reads and writes. We can achieve 100% consistency.
