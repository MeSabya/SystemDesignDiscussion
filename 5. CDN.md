# WHAT IS CDN AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

CDN or Content Delivery Network is a global network that is used to minimize the distance between the visitor and the Website server and reduce the network latency. It does this by caching static content for a website (i.e, images, HTML pages, javascript & CSS files, and videos) and loading the static content from the geographically closer server called PoP or Point of Presence.

## HOW DOES CDN WORK?

CDN is a collection of many caching servers in multiple geographical locations each(a.k.a., points of presence, or PoPs) connected together. Each PoP contains the cached version of the website. When a user requests a webpage the, CDN algorithm redirects the request to the server which is closest to the location of the requesting user(i.e, location with fewest hops), hence decreasing the latency and optimizing the performance.

## EXAMPLE OF CDN PROVIDERS
- Amazon Cloud Front
- CloudFare
- Azure CDN
- MaxCDN
- Google App Engine

## CDN Type

**Pool Base CDN**: when the first time to access the file, the system fetches the files remotely and store in the local CDN, then the next request will have a quick response.

**Push Base CDN**: wherever the data generated, distribute the data to other CDNs instantly.
