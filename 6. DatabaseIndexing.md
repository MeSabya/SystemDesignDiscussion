# Database — Indexing

What the DBMS will do when you ask for a specific row, it will go sequentially and check with every row; “Is this the row that I need?”, If yes return it, if no, keep searching till the end.
But, we have a better way to do that. An index, as we’ve mentioned, is a data structure, it won’t be obvious for you, but it’s stored inside the DBMS, most commonly as a B- tree.
By default, Most of the DBMS automatically create an index on primary and unique columns.

>B-Tree is a self-balancing search tree. In most of the other self-balancing search trees (like AVL and Red-Black Trees), it is assumed that everything is in main memory. To understand the use of B-Trees, we must think of the huge amount of data that cannot fit in main memory. When the number of keys is high, the data is read from disk in the form of blocks. Disk access time is very high compared to the main memory access time. The main idea of using B-Trees is to reduce the number of disk accesses. Most of the tree operations (search, insert, delete, max, min, ..etc ) require O(h) disk accesses where h is the height of the tree. B-tree is a fat tree. The height of B-Trees is kept low by putting maximum possible keys in a B-Tree node. Generally, the B-Tree node size is kept equal to the disk block size. Since the height of the B-tree is low so total disk accesses for most of the operations are reduced significantly compared to balanced Binary Search Trees like AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, ..etc.

*Indexing is a data structure technique that is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database.*

## How does Indexing work?

Suppose we have a users table(id, name) indexed on name. When a record is inserted in users table, respective entry in B-tree would be made. At the moment users table have entries (1, ‘Deepak’), (2, ‘Rohit’), (3, ‘MSD’), (4, ‘Aaradhya’). The indexed B-tree would look like [Aaradhya, Deepak, MSD, Rohit].

i:e 

👉 Let’s say that you have an index for a primary key. This will create an ordered list of primary key values in a separate table, each entry has a pointer points to the relative value in the original table.

👉 So, whenever you want to access a table using the primary key, it will use binary search algorithm (takes time of O(LogN)) to access the required value in the Index table, and then, go to the relative value in the original table.

## Indexing methods

1. Clustered Indexing: 
   When more than two records are stored in the same file (page) these types of stores are known as cluster indexing.   

2. Non-clustered or Secondary Indexing:
   A non-clustered index just tells us where the data lies, i.e. it gives us a list of virtual pointers or references to the location where the data is actually stored.
