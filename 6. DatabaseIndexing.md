# Database — Indexing

What the DBMS will do when you ask for a specific row, it will go sequentially and check with every row; “Is this the row that I need?”, If yes return it, if no, keep searching till the end.
But, we have a better way to do that. An index, as we’ve mentioned, is a data structure, it won’t be obvious for you, but it’s stored inside the DBMS, most commonly as a B- tree.
By default, Most of the DBMS automatically create an index on primary and unique columns.

 B-trees are self balancing tree data structures that are similar to binary tree searches. They perform all actions in a logarithmic time and can be sorted.

*Indexing is a data structure technique that is used to quickly locate and access the data in a database.*

## How does Indexing work?

Suppose we have a users table(id, name) indexed on name. When a record is inserted in users table, respective entry in B-tree would be made. At the moment users table have entries (1, ‘Deepak’), (2, ‘Rohit’), (3, ‘MSD’), (4, ‘Aaradhya’). The indexed B-tree would look like [Aaradhya, Deepak, MSD, Rohit].

i:e 

👉 Let’s say that you have an index for a primary key. This will create an ordered list of primary key values in a separate table, each entry has a pointer points to the relative value in the original table.

👉 So, whenever you want to access a table using the primary key, it will use binary search algorithm (takes time of O(LogN)) to access the required value in the Index table, and then, go to the relative value in the original table.

## Indexing methods

1. Clustered Indexing: 
   When more than two records are stored in the same file (page) these types of stores are known as cluster indexing.   

2. Non-clustered or Secondary Indexing:
   A non-clustered index just tells us where the data lies, i.e. it gives us a list of virtual pointers or references to the location where the data is actually stored.
