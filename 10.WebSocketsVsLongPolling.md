# What is the difference between Long-Polling, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events?

Long-Polling, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events are popular communication protocols between a client like a web browser and a web server.
First, let‚Äôs start with understanding what a standard HTTP web request looks like. 

>HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.

*HyperText Transfer Protocol is an application layer is a stateless application-level protocol where generally client requests information with headers using actions like GET, POST, PUT ‚Ä¶ and server sends the response back to the client and the connection is closed.*

For every communication, HTTP protocol will open a connection, data exchange then the connection is closed.

If the requirement is to fetch the data continuously from the server. For example fetch the real-time data for cryptocurrency exchange, gaming application or a chat application. Then there will be multiple HTTP calls to the server.

## Ajax Polling:

In Ajax polling, a client makes XHR(XMLHttpRequest)/Ajax requests to server repeatedly at some regular interval to check for new data.
A flow for Ajax polling will as follow.

- A client initiates requests at a small regular intervals (e.g 0.5 Seconds)
- The server prepares the response and sends it back to to the client just like normal HTTP requests.

Making repeated requests to server wastes resources as each new incoming connection must be established, the HTTP headers must be passed, a query for new data must be performed, and a response (usually with no new data to offer) must be generated and delivered. The connection must be closed and any resources cleaned up.

## Long Polling:

As in regular polling, rather than having to repeat this process multiple times for every client until new data for a given client becomes available, Long polling is technique where the server elects to hold a client connection open for as long as possible, delivering a response only after data becomes available or timeout threshold has been reached. After receiving response client immediately sends the next request.

**A flow for Long polling will look as follows**:

1. A client initiates an XHR/AJAX request, requesting some data from a server.
2. The server does not immediately respond with request information but waits until there is new information available.
3. When there is new information available, the server responds with new information.
4. The client receives the new information and immediately sends another request to the server restarting the process.

**Some challenges in long polling**:
üëâ Message ordering and delivery guarantees.
Message ordering cannot be guaranteed if the same client opens multiple connections to the server.
If the client was not able to receive the message then there will be possible message loss.
Performance and scaling
Device support and fallbacks

## WebSockets:
*WebSockets keeps the connection open, allowing messages to be passed back and forth between the client and the server. In this way, a two-way ongoing conversation can take place between the client and the server.*

The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a client and a web server with lesser overheads, providing real-time data transfer from and to the server.

üëâ It is different from HTTP but compatible with HTTP.

To achieve compatibility, the WebSocket handshake uses Upgrade header to update the protocol to the WebSocket protocol.

**A WebSocket connection flow will look something like this:**

1. A client initiates a WebSocket handshake process by sending a request which also contains Upgrade header to switch to WebSocket protocol along with other information.
   The server receives WebSocket handshake request and process it.

2(a). If the server can establish the connection and agrees with client terms then sends a response to the client, acknowledging the WebSocket handshake request with other information.

2(b). If the server can not establish the connection then it sends response acknowledging it cannot establish WebSocket connection.

3. Once the client receives a successful WebSocket connection handshake request, WebSocket connection will be opened. Now, client and servers can start sending data in both directions allowing real-time communication.

4. The connection will be closed once the server or the client decides to close the connection.

## Server Sent Events:

Unlike WebSockets, Server-Sent Events are a one-way communication channel where events flow from server to client only. Server-Sent Events allows browser clients to receive a stream of events from a server over an HTTP connection without polling.

üëâ A client subscribes to a ‚Äústream‚Äù from a server and the server will send messages (‚Äúevent-stream‚Äù) to the client until the server or the client closes the stream. It is up to the server to decide when and what to send the client, for instance as soon as data changes.

**A flow for server send events will be as follows**:

- Browser client creates a connection using an EventSource API with a server endpoint which is expected to return a stream of events over time. This essentially makes an HTTP request at given URL.
- The server receives a regular HTTP request from the client and opens the connection and keeps it open. The server can now send the event data as long as it wants or it can close the connection if there are no data.
- The client receives each event from the server and process it. If it receives a close signal from the server it can close the connection. The client can also initiate the connection close request.
