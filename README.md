# SystemDesign Learning Path

***Step1 Finish the Basics needed for System Design:***

- Database
   DB basics:
   - [ ] [How indexing Works internally](https://www.pankajtanwar.in/blog/how-database-indexing-actually-works-internally)
   - [ ] Relational database management system (RDBMS)
      - Master-slave replication
      - Master-master replication
      - Federation
      - Sharding [How Sharding works](https://medium.com/@jeeyoungk/how-sharding-works-b4dec46b3f6) 
      - Denormalization
      - SQL tuning
   - [ ] NoSQL
      - Key-value store
      - Document store
      - Wide column store
      - Graph Database
      - SQL or NoSQL

- Concurrency basics: threads, processes, threading in the language you know. Locks , mutex etc.
  - [ ] Pyhon concurrency concepts and problems: https://www.educative.io/courses/python-concurrency-for-senior-engineering-interviews

- A basic idea of how a basic web architecture is: say 
  - [ ] load balancers 
      1. [Details of LoadBalancing](https://medium.com/geekculture/load-balancing-da0bde7882f1)
      2. [Is client side load balancing a good idea](https://www.pankajtanwar.in/blog/system-design-is-client-side-load-balancing-a-good-idea)
  - [ ] [proxy Vs Reverse Proxy](https://www.pankajtanwar.in/blog/proxy-vs-reverse-proxy-using-a-real-life-example)
  - [ ] servers, 
  - [ ] Database servers, 
  - [ ] caching servers, 
  - [ ] precompute, 
  - [ ] logging big data etc. 
  - [ ] DNS
  - [ ] Horizontal scaling
  - [ ] Web server (reverse proxy)
  - [ ] API server (application layer)
  - [ ] Cache
  - [ ] Consistency patterns
  - [ ] Availability patterns
  - [ ] [Distributed Caching](https://medium.com/rtkal/distributed-cache-design-348cbe334df1)
  
  
  Just know broadly what is each layer for.
