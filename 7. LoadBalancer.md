# Load Balancer

*A load balancer is a vital component of any distributed system. It helps to distribute the client requests within a cluster of servers to improve the responsiveness and availability of applications or websites.*

The load balancer is a server that usually sits between client devices and a set of servers and distributes client requests across servers. Load balancers can be placed in various places of a system. The loads on the servers need to be distributed in a balanced way; thatâ€™s why they are called a load balancer.

## Functionalities Provided By Load Balancer

- Essential task of load balancers is to carry out continuous health checks on servers to ensure they can handle requests. 
- It ensures better use of system resources by balancing user requests. 
- In system design, horizontal scaling is a common strategy to scale our system in case of a large number of users. 
- A load balancer is a solution for horizontal scaling. 
- Through balancing the incoming traffic of a system, an LB prevents a server from becoming overloaded.And it prevents a single point of failure for any server. It also ensures better overall throughput of the system. Latencies should occur less often as requests are not blocked, and users donâ€™t need to wait for their requests to be processed. 

## Where do we use a Load balancer?

- We may add LBs at various places in the system. Especially where we have multiple resources like servers or database or cache.

## Why do we use Load Balancing?

**Here is some example of load-balancing usage:**

- When we design a system, one of its primary concerns creates a faster user experience and uninterrupted service. User requests should not wait for a single server that has not finished its previous task. In that case, client requests are immediately distributed to a responsive available server. Thatâ€™s when we need to use a load balancer; to balance out the tasks between multiple resources. Figure 1 is such an example:

- Availability is a key characteristic of a distributed system. In case of a full server failure scenario, this wonâ€™t affect the user experience as the load balancer will simply send the client request to a healthy server.

- We can use predictive analytics in a load balancer to determine traffic bottlenecks before they happen. It can help in making business decisions.

- Instead of a single resource performing a lot of work, load balancing ensures that several devices perform a bearable amount of work.

- Another task of a load balancer is to defend the system from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Software load balancers can provide efficient and cost-effective protection from the DoS attack.

## Server selection:

There are two main factors that a load balancer considers before forwarding a client request to a server:
  ðŸ‘‰ First, load balancers need to ensure that the chosen server is responsive; meaning that it is responding to its requests.
ðŸ‘‰ Secondly, the LBs use a pre-configured algorithm to select one from the set of responsive healthy servers.

### Health check: 
Load balancers need to forward traffic to healthy or responsive backend servers. To monitor the health, LBs constantly try to connect to backend servers to ensure that servers are listening. If a server fails to pingback in case of a health check, it is removed from the pool, and requests will not be forwarded to it until it is responsive again.

### Load Balancing Techniques:

#### Random selection:
In this method, the servers are selected randomly. There are no other factors calculated in the selection of the server. 

**Disadvantages**:
There might be a problem with some of the servers sitting idle, and some are overloaded with requests in this technique.

#### RoundRobin:
This is one of the most common load balancing methods. Itâ€™s a method where the LB redirects incoming traffic between a set of servers in a certain order.

Check figure above; there is a list of 3 servers; the first request goes to server 1, the second one goes to server 2, and so on. When LB reaches the end of the list, it starts over at the beginning, from server number 1 again. 

**Disadvantages**:

It almost evenly balances the traffic between the servers. But in this method, server specifications are not considered. 
The servers need to be of equal specification for this method to be useful. Otherwise, a low processing powered server may have the same load as a high processing capacity server.

#### Weighted Rounded Robin:
ðŸ‘‰ This method is designed to handle servers with different characteristics, which was a problem in the normal round-robin. 

A weight is assigned to each server. This weight can be an integer value that varies according to the processing power of the server. Higher processing servers get more connections to utilize their more powerful resources. So, here the traffic redirection depends on the processing power of the server.

#### Least Connection:
Here, the load balancer sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections at the time when the client request is received. If the servers are busy in long computations, and the connections between client and server stay alive for a larger period of time, this approach is useful.

#### Least Response time:
This algorithm sends the client requests to the server with the least active connections and the lowest response time (average). The backend server that responds the fastest receives the next request.
 
#### Source IP Hashing:
In this method, a hash of the clientâ€™s IP address is generated which is used to select a server for a client. Even if the connection is broken, the clientâ€™s next request will still go to the same server. So, this method can be used in a situation where clients need to be connected to a session that is still active after its disconnection. It can maximize our cache hits and improve performance.
