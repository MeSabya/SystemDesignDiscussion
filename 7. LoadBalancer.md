# Load Balancer

*A load balancer is a vital component of any distributed system. It helps to distribute the client requests within a cluster of servers to improve the responsiveness and availability of applications or websites.*

The load balancer is a server that usually sits between client devices and a set of servers and distributes client requests across servers. Load balancers can be placed in various places of a system. The loads on the servers need to be distributed in a balanced way; thatâ€™s why they are called a load balancer.

## Functionalities Provided By Load Balancer

- Essential task of load balancers is to carry out continuous health checks on servers to ensure they can handle requests. 
- It ensures better use of system resources by balancing user requests. 
- In system design, horizontal scaling is a common strategy to scale our system in case of a large number of users. 
- A load balancer is a solution for horizontal scaling. 
- Through balancing the incoming traffic of a system, an LB prevents a server from becoming overloaded.And it prevents a single point of failure for any server. It also ensures better overall throughput of the system. Latencies should occur less often as requests are not blocked, and users donâ€™t need to wait for their requests to be processed. 

## Where do we use a Load balancer?

- We may add LBs at various places in the system. Especially where we have multiple resources like servers or database or cache.

## Why do we use Load Balancing?

**Here is some example of load-balancing usage:**

- When we design a system, one of its primary concerns creates a faster user experience and uninterrupted service. User requests should not wait for a single server that has not finished its previous task. In that case, client requests are immediately distributed to a responsive available server. Thatâ€™s when we need to use a load balancer; to balance out the tasks between multiple resources. Figure 1 is such an example:

- Availability is a key characteristic of a distributed system. In case of a full server failure scenario, this wonâ€™t affect the user experience as the load balancer will simply send the client request to a healthy server.

- We can use predictive analytics in a load balancer to determine traffic bottlenecks before they happen. It can help in making business decisions.

- Instead of a single resource performing a lot of work, load balancing ensures that several devices perform a bearable amount of work.

- Another task of a load balancer is to defend the system from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Software load balancers can provide efficient and cost-effective protection from the DoS attack.

## Server selection:

There are two main factors that a load balancer considers before forwarding a client request to a server:
  ðŸ‘‰ First, load balancers need to ensure that the chosen server is responsive; meaning that it is responding to its requests.
ðŸ‘‰ Secondly, the LBs use a pre-configured algorithm to select one from the set of responsive healthy servers.

### Health check: 
Load balancers need to forward traffic to healthy or responsive backend servers. To monitor the health, LBs constantly try to connect to backend servers to ensure that servers are listening. If a server fails to pingback in case of a health check, it is removed from the pool, and requests will not be forwarded to it until it is responsive again.
